# BUILDLOG — the build's live state

Append-only. This is where every build session records what it did, so **any** Claude
Code session (this chat, another chat, a second agent) can cold-start and continue from
the repo alone. The protocol lives in [`CODEGEN.md`](CODEGEN.md) §0 / §6; the short
version:

- **Start a session:** run the cold-start ritual (read this file, `git log --oneline -8`,
  Supabase MCP `list_migrations` + `list_tables`, `node docs/design/verify.mjs`), then add
  an `IN PROGRESS:` line claiming what you're taking.
- **End a session (green only):** verify → commit → append a `## <date> — <phase.session>`
  entry with **DONE** (commit sha + migration name), **NEXT** (the exact next item), and any
  **GOTCHA** — then clear your `IN PROGRESS` line and push.
- **Ground truth is the DB + git**, not this prose. If `list_migrations` disagrees with the
  committed `schema-*.sql`, reconcile before building on top.

Entry template:
```
## 2026-08-DD — P1.3 channels + policies
IN PROGRESS: (cleared)
DONE: schema-04-channels.sql applied (migration "p1_3_channels") + committed <sha>.
      allow/deny tests pass; get_advisors security clean; types regenerated.
NEXT: P1.4 messages (+ body_tsv, parent_id, tombstones), CANON §E.1/§E.8.
GOTCHA: channels.post_policy='admins' must reject non-admin inserts — test covers it.
```

## Current state

**Phase: design & contract — COMPLETE. Build: NOT STARTED.**

The spec is hand-off-ready: [`CANON.md`](CANON.md) is the contract (incl. §E.10, the
per-control → backend coverage matrix), the [`design/gallery.html`](design/gallery.html)
gallery is the visual law with `verify.mjs` green, and [`CODEGEN.md`](CODEGEN.md) is the
playbook. The frontend stack is locked (vanilla + signals, no build step; CANON §G).

**NEXT: P0 — Scaffold.** Read CODEGEN §5 (P0) + CANON §C.3 + `prompts/P0-scaffold.md`.
Prereq the first backend session needs: a Supabase project (URL + publishable key via
`get_project_url` / `get_publishable_keys`) and the R2/Vercel env from `.env.example`.

IN PROGRESS: (none)
